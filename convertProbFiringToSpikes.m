% function [X_spt,G_spt,Xspikes] = convertProbFiringToSpikes(X,G,NeuralPrs)
%
% This function converts probability of firing data (output of
% "neuralTransformationOfData" function) into time-to-first-spike data.
% Note that this function creates a matrix of the time to first spike
% *within each wingstroke* at each sensor location.  The number of data
% points in the data matrix will be greatly reduced (e.g., if there are 40
% time points per wingstroke in the original X matrix, these 40 points will 
% be reduced to a single data point in the X_spt matrix).
%
% The function inputs are
%   X: original data matrix, sensor locations x time points
%   G: class vector for matrix X
%   ParStruct: parameter structure which contains
%       refPer: refractory period, ms
%       sampFreq: sampling frequency, points/sec
%       flapFrequency: frequency of flapping, flaps/sec
%
% The function outputs are
%   X_spt: new data matrix of times to first spike, sensor locations x wingstroke number
%   G_spt: new matrix of classes for X_spt
%   Xspikes: matrix of spiking data (0s and 1s) at original time resolution
